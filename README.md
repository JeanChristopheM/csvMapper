# CSV mapper

This project lets you remap a csv file :

In index.js line #19, replace `original.csv` by the name of your input file.

In the `.on('end')` function, line #22, manipulate your csv to remap it.

Then finally replace `output.csv` by your desired file name.

Make sure your input file is in your directory and once ready, execute the command `node index.js` inside your repository.
